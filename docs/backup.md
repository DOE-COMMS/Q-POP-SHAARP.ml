## Numerical simulation of SHG responses for materials with known SHG coefficients   
- Input parameters
	- Materials properties 
		- Crystallographic orientation of sample 
		- Layer thickness of sample 
		- Refractive indices/dielectric coefficients at the optical frequency 
		- SHG coefficients 
	- Incident waves 
		- Under the plane-wave assumption 
		- Angle of incidence 
		- Wavelength in vacuum 
		- 
	- Polarizer/analyzer 
		- 
- Output results 
	- Fresnel coefficients (reflected and transmitted SHG intensities of the fundamental wave as a function of incident angle)
	- Maker fringes (transmitted SHG intensity of the SHG wave as a function of incident angle)
	- SHG Polarimetry
		- Polar plots of the s- and p-polarized SHG signals 
		- choice of rotated/fixed polarizer and rotated/fixed analyzer 
	-
